# cors-unblocker is a Cross browser extension.
It allows you to whitelist urls so that you can git clone them and interact with them via the git smart protocol.

## Why?
There are still many hosters that do not send a valid cross origin allow header this adds that via a browser extension.
isomorphic-git legacy did use most time a cors-proxy but i find that is to hard to maintain and only usefull if you want.
to host or proxy existing hosting providers for 3rd party users that clone that via the web.
