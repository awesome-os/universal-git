## universal-git

<h3 align="center">A modern, maintained, and universal JavaScript Git implementation. With batterys Included!</h3>

<p align="center">
 is a pure JavaScript implementation of Git, designed to run in any modern JavaScript environment. It is an actively maintained fork of the popular isomorphic-git library, extended with powerful new features for large-scale, programmatic source code management. The library offers universal compatibility, running seamlessly in Node.js, Deno, Bun, browsers, Web Workers, and specialized runtimes like Cloudflare Workers, V8 Isolates, and GraalVM. It is built for scale, including critical features like sparse checkouts designed for efficiently managing gigantic monorepos, and serves as a core dependency for a growing number of community projects. The motivation for this fork was born from the needs of compiler engineering and large-scale infrastructure development. When working on projects like Chromium, programmatic access to Git is essential for automating tasks across thousands of codebases and millions of lines of code. This library is a key component in the development of a next-generation, peer-to-peer (p2p) distributed build system‚Äîa conceptual replacement for Google's GOMA‚Äîdesigned to handle the unique challenges of giant, Git-based monorepos.

`universal-git` forked from `isomorphic-git`, was created to provide the community with a stable, actively maintained library that embraces modern JavaScript, fixes long-standing bugs, and offers a clear path forward.

If you've been frustrated by the lack of updates or unresolved issues in `isomorphic-git`, you've come to the right place.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
npm install universal-git
# or
yarn add universal-git
# or
pnpm add universal-git
```

### 2. Usage Example: Clone a Repository (Node.js)

The API is designed to be intuitive and powerful. Here‚Äôs how you can clone a repository:

```javascript
// index.mjs
import fs from 'node:fs'
import http from 'node:http' // Use a proper http client in production
import { clone } from 'universal-git'

// This is where we'll clone the repo
const dir = './cloned-repo';

// Let's go!
clone({
  fs,
  http,
  dir,
  url: 'https://github.com/awesome-os/universal-git',
  onMessage: (message) => console.log(message), // Real-time progress updates
  onProgress: (progress) => console.log(`${progress.phase}: ${progress.loaded}/${progress.total}`),
}).then(
  () => console.log('‚úÖ Repository cloned successfully!'),
  (error) => console.error('‚ùå Cloning failed:', error)
);
```

## üöö Incremental Migrating from `isomorphic-git`

```bash
npm install isomorphic-git@npm:universal-git
```

That's it! The core API remains compatible, but you now benefit from all the underlying improvements and a modern `async/await`-first design.

**Note** for developers and lib authors
last week a feature got added to require('ismorphic-git/modules and others') you do not need that for universal-git you can directly import everything from 'universal-git' or 'isomorphic-git' by its name.
Your bundler eg rollup or vite or esbuild will automagically only take what you used. If you want to depend on this and did before use the isomorphic-git/src/ files then change to the new pattern.
depend directly on universal-git


## How to depend on universal-git
Here is a very good and standard way to do this in ESM. The key is to create a "proxy" or "facade" module. Since ESM `export` bindings are immutable (you can't change what a module exports after it's been defined), you can't modify the original module in-place. Instead, you create a new module that re-exports everything from the original *except* for the one you want to override, which you provide yourself.

This new module then has the identical "shape" and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

### The "Proxy Module" Pattern

Let's say you have a library called `original-library.js` and you want to override its `doSomething` function.

#### 1. The Original Module (`original-library.js`)

```javascript
// original-library.js

export const doSomething = () => {
  console.log("Doing the original thing.");
  return "original_value";
};

export const doSomethingElse = () => {
  console.log("Doing something else.");
  return "another_value";
};

export const PI = 3.14159;
```

#### 2. The Patched Proxy Module (`patched-library.js`)

This is where the magic happens. We'll create a new file that acts as our replacement.

```javascript
// patched-library.js

// Step 1: Re-export ALL named exports from the original module.
// This is the most crucial part. It passes through everything we don't touch.
export * from './original-library.js';

// Step 2: Define your new, overriding implementation.
const patchedDoSomething = () => {
  console.log("Doing the NEW, patched thing!");
  // You can even call the original if you need to wrap it (see advanced example below)
  return "patched_value";
};

// Step 3: Export your patched function USING THE ORIGINAL NAME.
// This explicit export takes precedence over the one from the wildcard (*) export.
export { patchedDoSomething as doSomething };
```

**How it works:**
The `export * from './original-library.js'` statement re-exports `doSomething`, `doSomethingElse`, and `PI`. However, the next line, `export { patchedDoSomething as doSomething }`, creates a *second* export named `doSomething`. In ESM, explicit named exports in the current file always win over re-exports from another module.

#### 3. Using the Patched Module (`main.js`)

Now, any code that needs the patched behavior simply imports from your new module instead of the original one.

```javascript
// main.js

// Instead of: import * as lib from './original-library.js';
import * as lib from './patched-library.js';

// --- The code below doesn't need to change at all! ---

const result1 = lib.doSomething(); // Will call the patched version
const result2 = lib.doSomethingElse(); // Will call the original version
const piValue = lib.PI; // Will use the original constant

console.log({ result1, result2, piValue });
```

**Running this would produce:**

```
Doing the NEW, patched thing!
Doing something else.
{ result1: 'patched_value', result2: 'another_value', piValue: 3.14159 }
```

As you can see, the `lib` object has the exact same shape, but the `doSomething` function has been successfully replaced.

---

### Advanced Use Case: Wrapping the Original Function

Sometimes you don't want to completely replace a function, but rather add behavior around it (like logging, caching, or validation). The pattern supports this beautifully.

```javascript
// patched-wrapper-library.js

// Re-export everything to maintain the module shape
export * from './original-library.js';

// Import the specific function we want to wrap, but give it an alias
import { doSomething as originalDoSomething } from './original-library.js';

// Define our new wrapper function that CALLS the original
const wrappedDoSomething = () => {
  console.log("LOG: 'doSomething' is about to be called.");
  const startTime = performance.now();

  const result = originalDoSomething(); // <-- Call the original!

  const endTime = performance.now();
  console.log(`LOG: 'doSomething' finished in ${endTime - startTime}ms.`);

  // You can even modify the result if you want
  return `wrapped(${result})`;
};

// Export our wrapper using the original name
export { wrappedDoSomething as doSomething };
```

### create a Bundle of multiple entryPoints into a single entryPoint that exports everything.
```js
import multi from '@rollup/plugin-multi-entry';

export default {
  input: ["node_modules/universal-git/universal-git.js",""],
  output: {
    dir: 'output'
  },
  plugins: [multi()]
};
```

## üöö FULL Migrating from `isomorphic-git`

Migrating is designed to be painless. For most projects, it's a simple 2-step process:

1.  **Uninstall the old package and install the new one:**
    ```bash
    npm uninstall isomorphic-git
    npm install universal-git
    ```

2.  **Update your imports:**
    Change all occurrences of `'isomorphic-git'` to `'universal-git'`.

    **Before:**
    ```javascript
    const git = require('isomorphic-git')
    // or
    import { clone } from 'isomorphic-git'
    ```

    **After:**
    ```javascript
    const git = require('universal-git') // CJS still supported
    // or (recommended)
    import { clone } from 'universal-git'
    ```

That's it! The core API remains compatible, but you now benefit from all the underlying improvements and a modern `async/await`-first design.
